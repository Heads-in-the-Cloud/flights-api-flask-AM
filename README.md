# Flights API Repository (Flask)

This repository holds the source code for the Flights API built in Flask.

The program is intended to run in a Docker container. If not using Docker or docker-compose to run the code, several environment variables must be defined for the database connection:
* DB_IP (mysql url endpoint)
* DB_NAME (mysql database name)
* DB_USERNAME (mysql admin account username)
* DB_PASSWORD (mysql admin account password)
These variables must also be passed as environment variables to any Docker container created manually.

## Docker

This code is compiled into a Docker image held at amattsonsm/flights-api-flask
